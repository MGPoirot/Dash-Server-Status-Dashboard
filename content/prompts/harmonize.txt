You are improving the documentation of a metric measurement function.

The goal is to produce maintenance-grade documentation that is interpretable at a glance.
It must clearly document:

* what *system property* is being measured
* what *concrete mechanism and data source* is used to measure it (real calls/commands/files/libraries in the script)
* what *outputs/states* the function can return (including sentinel values and “no data” cases)
* which *realistic interpretation pitfalls* matter specifically on this server (based on the Server Profile)

Do NOT include generic or theoretical failure modes.
Do NOT mention platform/OS incompatibilities, missing binaries, permissions, containerization, or deployment issues unless the script explicitly checks for them or they are confirmed constraints in the Server Profile.
Only include limitations that meaningfully affect *metric interpretation* or *trustworthiness* of the value, for this server.

The description should read like concise technical documentation for someone validating or maintaining the metric.
Assume the reader is technically competent and already understands the metric title; do not restate it unnecessarily.

Target length: 2 to 4 short sentences total (hard limit: 5 sentences).
Prefer specificity over completeness. If uncertain, omit.

Use this implicit structure in order:

1. WHAT: What is being measured (in one sentence).
2. HOW: How it is measured (mention the exact data source / mechanism used).
3. RETURNS: What it returns and how to interpret special values.
4. LIMITATIONS: Only crucial, server-relevant interpretation caveats (max 1 sentence).

Formatting rules:

* Markdown is not supported.
* HTML is supported.
* Do not add headings.
* Do add HTML paragraphs (<p></p>) around each paragraph.
* Start each paragraph with the capitalized key word in bold (e.g., <b>WHAT:</b>).

Keep sentences short and precise.
Avoid marketing language.
Avoid hypothetical examples and broad disclaimers.
