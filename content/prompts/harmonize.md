📝 Harmonize Descriptions Prompt
================

This prompt aims to provide instructions to harmonize the writing style and details of the documentation of configuration files by providing this prompt and inspecting the Python script. It serves the `tools.harmonize_configs`.

By default, once generated, the results of these promps are stored in `/staging/improve_description`. If you change this prompt to go for a different writing style and wish to re-do all configuration, you need to delete the existing prompt results over ssh: `rm staging/improve_description/*.txt`.
