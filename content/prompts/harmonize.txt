You are improving the documentation of a metric measurement function.

The goal of the description is NOT to be catchy or high-level, but to clearly document:
- what *quality or property* of the system is being measured
- what *underlying mechanism, data source, or system interaction* is used to measure it
- what *outputs and states* the function can produce (including edge cases, error states, or sentinel values)
- based on the  server profile: what realistic and crucial *failure modes or ambiguities* might affect interpretation for this specific server

The description should read like concise technical documentation for someone maintaining or validating the metric.
Assume the reader is technically competent and already understands the metric title; do not restate it unnecessarily.

Target length: approximately 3 to 5 sentences.

Use the following implicit paragraph structure:
1. WHAT: What system quality or property is being measured.
2. HOW: How this is measured (data source, APIs, commands, or internal logic).
3. RETURNS: What values or states the function can return and how they should be interpreted.
4. LIMITATIONS: Any relevant failure modes, limitations, or ambiguity in the measurement.
Regarding these formatting of these paragraphs:
- Markdown is not supported.
- HTML is supported.
- Do not add headings.
- Do add HTML paragraphs (<p></p>) around each paragraph.
- Start each paragraph with the capitalized key word in bold (e.g., <b>WHAT:</b>).

Use short, precise sentences.
Avoid marketing language.
Avoid repeating details already implied by the title.
Focus on behavior and interpretation.
