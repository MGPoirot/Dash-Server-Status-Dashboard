You are generating TWO FILES for a server-metrics dashboard on a Debian 12 (OpenMediaVault) host, based on the provided Server Profile JSON below.

You MUST output exactly:
1) A single metric “config” JSON object (not an array)
2) A single Python 3.12.12 script that implements a no-arg main() function and prints one JSON record to stdout

Separate the two files with a line that is exactly:
==========

No other text, no markdown fences, no commentary.

========================
SERVER PROFILE (source of truth)
========================
{{SERVER_PROFILE}}

========================
OUTPUT FORMAT (hard requirements - must follow)
========================
A) First file: CONFIG JSON
{{CONFIG_PROMPT}}

B) Second file: PYTHON SCRIPT (Python 3.12.12)
{{SCRIPT_PROMPT}}

========================
ALARM MATCHING REQUIREMENT (critical)
========================
The Python script’s output must be designed so that EACH alarm in the configs JSON can be evaluated purely from the emitted JSON record:
- Numeric thresholds compare against "v" (or "a" if applies_to="a")
- String alarms use contains/not_contains against "v" (or "a")
- If you include a "stale" alarm, set it up in the configs JSON as a time-since-last-success policy (threshold in seconds) but DO NOT implement staleness logic in the script (the dashboard handles staleness using timestamps).

========================
TASK (monitoring proposal)
========================
Given the following monitoring proposal in brackets, produce the TWO FILES exactly as specified, separated by "==========".
